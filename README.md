# Rent_prediction_Using_Regression_Models

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to select the best-performing regression model to predict rental prices. The aim is to develop a model that can accurately predict the rent of apartments in Muratpaşa, Antalya based on various features.

## Dataset Description
**Dataset Description:** Rental Apartment Listings in Muratpaşa, Antalya (January 2024)

This dataset contains rental apartment listings data for the Muratpaşa district of Antalya for January 2024. The dataset was manually compiled by scraping listings from the web and includes various attributes of the rental apartments. This dataset can be used for various purposes such as analyzing the rental housing market, developing pricing strategies, and studying real estate trends.

**Example Use Case:**

With this dataset, you can perform detailed analyses on the prices and features of rental apartments in the Muratpaşa district of Antalya, create price prediction models, or identify market trends.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is available in the repository: [antalya_kiralik_ev.csv](antalya_kiralik_ev.csv)

## Project Goals and Objectives
The main objective of this project is to select the best performing regression model to predict rental prices. The project aims to develop a model that provides the most accurate rent predictions based on various features of the apartments.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `sklearn` for machine learning models
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Installation and Setup
Since the project is built on a Jupyter notebook, you can run it by simply clicking the run button in the notebook environment. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.

## Project Structure
The project contains functions for regression and visualization. The main components are:

#Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
#Model Training: Training various regression models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics.
#Visualization: Visualizing the results and insights from the data.
## Results and Findings
The best performing model achieved an R² score of 0.45 and an RMSE of 0.63. These results indicate the model's ability to predict rental prices to a moderate degree of accuracy.

## Future Work
Future improvements will focus on enhancing the model's performance metrics, including increasing the R² score and reducing the RMSE. This could involve exploring more advanced regression techniques, feature engineering, and data augmentation.
